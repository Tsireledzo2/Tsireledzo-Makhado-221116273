# Tsireledzo Wisdom Makhado Rust Application
## About
This project is a basic hello world webApp. But all I had to do was to make it work in the browser not the terminal as the default rust setup makes the app work using a terminal.

## How to run it?
1. Download/Clone the repo
2. Make sure you have rust installed in your machine, if not use this command "curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh"
3. Now you must build the project using this command "cargo build"
4. Run the project using this command "cargo run"
5. The project will be working on this link 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/'

## ScreenShot
The project should look like this when running.
